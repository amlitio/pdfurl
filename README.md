# pdfurl


pdfurl is a Python tool for downloading PDF files from URLs.

## Getting Started

To use pdfurl, you will need Python 3 and the required dependencies installed on your machine. 
You can install the dependencies by running the following command in the project directory:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start using pdfurl by running the following command:

```
python pdfurl.py <URL> [-o output.pdf]
```

## Usage

The basic syntax for using pdfurl is as follows:

```
python pdfurl.py <URL> [-o output.pdf]
```

- `<URL>`: The URL of the PDF file you want to download.
- `-o output.pdf`: (Optional) The filename and path where you want to save the downloaded PDF file. If not specified, the PDF file will be saved in the current directory with the same name as the URL.

To download a PDF file from a URL, run the following command:

```
python pdfurl.py https://www.example.com/file.pdf
```

This will download the PDF file and save it in the current directory with the name `file.pdf`.

If you want to specify a different filename or path for the downloaded PDF file, use the `-o` option followed by the desired filename and path:

```
python pdfurl.py https://www.example.com/file.pdf -o /path/to/newfilename.pdf
```

This will download the PDF file and save it in the specified path with the name `newfilename.pdf`.
